##
# In a particular jurisdiction, older license plates consist of three letters followed by
# three digits. When all of the license plates following that pattern had been used, the
# format was changed to four digits followed by three letters.
# Write a function that generates a random license plate. Your function should have
# approximately equal odds of generating a sequence of characters for an old license
# plate or a new license plate. Write a main program that calls your function and
# displays the randomly generated license plate.
