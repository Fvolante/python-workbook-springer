## 
# The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a technique that was developed more than 2,000 years
# ago to easily find all of the prime numbers between 2 and some limit, say 100. A
# description of the algorithm follows:
#
# Write down all of the numbers from 0 to the limit
# Cross out 0 and 1 because they are not prime
# Set p equal to 2
# While p is less than the limit do
# Cross out all multiples of p (but not p itself)
# Set p equal to the next number in the list that is not crossed out
# Report all of the numbers that have not been crossed out as prime
#
# The key to this algorithm is that it is relatively easy to cross out every nth number
# on a piece of paper. This is also an easy task for a computerâ€”a for loop can simulate
# this behavior when a third parameter is provided to the range function. When a
# number is crossed out, we know that it is no longer prime, but it still occupies space
# on the piece of paper, and must still be considered when computing later prime
# numbers. As a result, you should not simulate crossing out a number by removing
# it from the list. Instead, you should simulate crossing out a number by replacing it
# with 0. Then, once the algorithm completes, all of the non-zero values in the list are
# prime.
# Create a Python program that uses this algorithm to display all of the prime
# numbers between 2 and a limit entered by the user. If you implement the algorithm
# correctly you should be able to display all of the prime numbers less than 1,000,000
# in a few seconds.
