# One of the first known examples of encryption was used by Julius Caesar. Caesar
# needed to provide written instructions to his generals, but he didnâ€™t want his enemies
# to learn his plans if the message slipped into their hands. As a result, he developed
# what later became known as the Caesar cipher.
# The idea behind this cipher is simple (and as such, it provides no protection against
# modern code breaking techniques). Each letter in the original message is shifted by
# 3 places. As a result, A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, D becomes G, etc.
# The last three letters in the alphabet are wrapped around to the beginning: X becomes
# A, Y becomes B and Z becomes C. Non-letter characters are not modified by the
# cipher.
# Write a program that implements a Caesar cipher. Allow the user to supply the
# message and the shift amount, and then display the shifted message. Ensure that
# your program encodes both uppercase and lowercase letters. Your program should
# also support negative shift values so that it can be used both to encode messages and
# decode messages.

# set limit variable for letters shifting outside number list of unicode characters
ALPH_LIMIT = 26

# user's inputs and set new line variable
line = input("Inserisci un messaggio: ")
shift_amount = int(input("Inserisci il numero di spostamenti (validi anche numeri negativi): "))
