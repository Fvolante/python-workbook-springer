##
# Exercise 52 includes a table that shows the conversion from letter grades to grade
# points at a particular academic institution. In this exercise you will compute the
# grade point average of an arbitrary number of letter grades entered by the user. The
# user will enter a blank line to indicate that all of the grades have been provided. For
# example, if the user enters A, followed by C+, followed by B, followed by a blank
# line then your program should report a grade point average of 3.1.
# You may find your solution to Exercise 52 helpful when completing this exercise.
# Your program does not need to do any error checking. It can assume that each value
# entered by the user will always be a valid letter grade or a blank line.
